abstract = {Data regularization, seismic trace interpolation and extrapolation are advantages of partial zero offset CRS stacks. We edit the SIGSBEE2A synthetic data record to create sparse data. The gaps are chosen randomly in different offset ranges. We compare the results of the interpolation with the traces we deleted from the record. The interpolation by partial stacks preserves arrival times and frequencies very well. Especially the arrival times in near-offset are preserved with sub-sampling accuracy. Although the partial stack determines the attributes for the zero offset ray the trace interpolation for offset seismograms gives very satisfactory results. Best interpolation results are obtained for short or intermediate offsets.},
